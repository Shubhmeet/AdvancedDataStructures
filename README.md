Implementation of Advanced Data Structures

Helper Classes : Shuffle(to shuffle elements) , Timer (to measure time elasped) 

Sort.java : Implementation for differnt sorting algorithms to handle Array size upto 1M-16M                                               
            1. MergeSort Implemented for Generic Array                                                         
            2. MergeSort Implemented for primitive type array                                                                             
            3. Insertion Sort for Generic Array
            
Diameter.java : Find the longest path available in the tree from one node to another

LargestElementLessthenX.java : Find the largest number in sorted array which is less then or equal to x in o(nlogn)

RearrangePostiveNegative.java : Rearrange the elements of the array such that all the negatives are followed by positive maintaing their relative order with each other in O(nlogn) and o(1) space

kMissingNumbers.java : Find the k missing numbers in sorted array in O(k+logn) time

Fibonacci.java : compute the nth Fibonacci number in O(logn ) time for Big Integers , improving RT from O(n)

QuickSort.java : implements quick sort and dual quick sort , RT of 100M array size is less then 18 sec

MergeSort4Version.java : implements four different versions of merge sort , and the best one working in 17 sec for 100M array size , by removing unnecary work copying to temp array in merge operation.

BestVersionsMergenQuickSort.java : Implements the best versions of merge sort and dual pivot quick sort
